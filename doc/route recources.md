Here’s the route definition for handling the **Create Organization** page and form submission:

### **Add Resourceful Routes**
In your `routes/web.php` file, add a resource route for `organizations`:

```php
Route::resource('organizations', OrganizationController::class);
```

This single line will generate all the necessary routes for CRUD operations, including:

- `GET /organizations` → `index()` (List organizations)
- `GET /organizations/create` → `create()` (Show the create form)
- `POST /organizations` → `store()` (Handle form submission)
- `GET /organizations/{organization}` → `show()` (View an organization)
- `GET /organizations/{organization}/edit` → `edit()` (Show the edit form)
- `PUT/PATCH /organizations/{organization}` → `update()` (Update an organization)
- `DELETE /organizations/{organization}` → `destroy()` (Delete an organization)

---

### **Specific Route for the Create Page**
If you want to define only the create and store routes manually:
```php
Route::get('organizations/create', [OrganizationController::class, 'create'])->name('organizations.create');
Route::post('organizations', [OrganizationController::class, 'store'])->name('organizations.store');
```

---

### **Accessing the Route in Blade**
In your Blade views, use the `route` helper to link to these routes:
```php
<a href="{{ route('organizations.create') }}">Create Organization</a>
```

With the resource route, all CRUD endpoints are set up, and the `create` and `store` actions will be connected to their respective methods in the `OrganizationController`.
